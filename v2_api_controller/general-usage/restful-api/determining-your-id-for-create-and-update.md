Depending on which model you are accessing, the :id record can be specified differently.

When Bright is used to connect with an external course provider (like SCORMCloud), the
course provider generated guid can be used for :id.  Bright is not strongly tied to any particular
course provider, and thus use the following naming convention for external course providers ids:

 * registration_guid - this is the ID of a registration in the external course provider
 * course_guid - this is the ID of the course in the external course provider

Because Bright considers courses to be provided by a 'course provider', you will see fields returned
by the Bright API with names like:

 * provider_completed_at
 * provider_accessed_at
 * provider_error_message

etc.  This is an indication that the data is not generated by Bright, but from the external course
provider.

Please see the API documentuntation for a particular module to see information on how to correctly
specify the :id field.

See the [registration](#api-modules-registration-determining-your-id-for-create-and-update) section
for an example.
