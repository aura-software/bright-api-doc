For registrations, Bright maintains a GUID that can be used as the :id field when using
create, update, gcreate, or gupdate methods.

If course provider is SCORMCloud, this will be identical to the SCORMCloud registration id.

For other course providers, the GUID will be a Bright generated unique ID.
