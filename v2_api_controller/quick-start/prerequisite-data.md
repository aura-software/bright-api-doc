* **Your Bright API URL**.  This will be provided to you and is based on where your Bright server is installed, and what
DNS entry is used to access it.  Don't know it?  Ask us at support@aura-software.com!


You should also have your [Bright Realm ID and Secret key](#access-modes-via-realm-id-and-secret-key), which can be obtained from <a href="https://bright.aura-software.com/contact-us/" target="Bright Support">Bright Support</a>.

See the section on [access modes] for your alternatives for authenticating with Bright Server.

You can also access Bright with a Bright realm app id and key [see section](#access-modes-via-realm-id-and-secret-key).

Certain functionality can only be accessed with a realm key, such as invitations or the utilization of multiple course providers.

For the purposes of this example, we will use the following:

* Bright API URL: https://[BRIGHT URL]/bright/api/v2
* Bright Realm Guid: **sJtL8PtZG8S0z9bxkjPQ&**
* Bright Realm Secret Key: **PcQVlfCTIUebps3T268XKzAXvdzFpgc5svkM0uu38Zw**

For your environment, use your realm guid and secret key provided by <a href="https://bright.aura-software.com/contact-us/" target="Bright Support">Bright Support</a>.

With the above information, we can already use our API.  To do so, we can test this straight from curl a command line tool that is
easy to install on most systems.

When learning the Bright API, we recommend you start by assembling some simple curl commands from your command line in order to get
a feel for what is possible.

So let's get our list of courses from our API:

```shell
curl 'https://[BRIGHT URL]/bright/api/v2/course.xml?realm_guid=sJtL8PtZG8S0z9bxkjPQ&
realm_secret_key=PcQVlfCTIUebps3T268XKzAXvdzFpgc5svkM0uu38Zw'
```

If you've executed this correctly, you'll get a result like:

And the result:

```xml
