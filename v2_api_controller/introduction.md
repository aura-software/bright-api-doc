This document describes how to use version 2 of the Bright API.

The Bright API provides programmatic access to a variety of functions provided by the Bright platform, most
significantly read and write access to the Bright database.  Via the API it is possible to register users, assign
courses, generate launch URLs, and query results.

This document details how to get connected to the Bright Server, how to authenticate, and what functions
are available via which API calls.  It also covers what to do when things go wrong, and how to get more information.

More information about Bright and the Bright platform can be accessed from the [Bright Homepage](https://www.aura-software.com/bright) or
